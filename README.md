# Cytosine Methylation
These are part of the scripts for the analysis of DNA cytosine methylomes of two ecotypes (P. hallii var. hallii and P. hallii var. filipes). The aim of the project is to see the difference of the two methylomes at different development stages of leaf, and see if cytosine methylation is the cause of differential expression at the same stages.
